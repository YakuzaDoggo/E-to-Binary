# E-to-Binary
Stupid program I wrote

## Warning
Just a heads up, but this program can only run in a Windows environment. Sorry Linux and Mac users!

## Installation
Download the executable from [here](https://github.com/YakuzaDoggo/E-to-Binary/releases) and run it. Simple.

## Usage
Insert the binary e with **no** spaces. The program doesn't like spaces one bit. Following that it's just using your big brain power to read and tap a key on your keyboard twice.

**Alternatively**... you can have the program read a file. Just make a text document with the binary (again, no spaces), drop it into the SavedFiles folder and choose the read the file option. Just type in the file name (do **not** include '.txt') and you're good to go!

## Example
- Say someone wrote to you "eEEeEeee eEEeeEeE eEEeEEee eEEeEEee eEEeEEEE"
- Open the handy-dandy program and write the message, but with out spaces (so it's now "eEEeEeeeeEEeeEeEeEEeEEeeeEEeEEeeeEEeEEEE")
- Press enter and watch for the message
