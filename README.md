# E-to-Binary
Stupid program I wrote

## Warning
Just a heads up, but this program can only run in a Windows environment. Sorry Linux and Mac users!

## Installation
Download the executable from [here](https://github.com/YakuzaDoggo/E-to-Binary/releases) and run it. Simple.

## Usage
Insert the binary e.
- Having the program read an already existing text documents allows you to include spaces.
- Manually putting in the binary requires **no** spaces.
Following that it's just using your big brain power to read and tap a key on your keyboard twice.

## Example
- Say someone wrote to you "eEEeEeee eEEeeEeE eEEeEEee eEEeEEee eEEeEEEE"
- Open the handy-dandy program and write the message, but with out spaces (so it's now "eEEeEeeeeEEeeEeEeEEeEEeeeEEeEEeeeEEeEEEE")
- Press enter and watch for the message
